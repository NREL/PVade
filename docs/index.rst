Welcome to PVade's documentation!
=================================

PVade is an open source fluid-structure interaction model which can be used to study wind loading and stability on solar-tracking PV arrays. PVade can be used as part of a larger modeling chain to provide stressor inputs to mechanical module models to study the physics of failure for degradation mechanisms such as cell cracking, weathering of cracked cells, and glass breakage.

Organization
------------

Documentation is currently organized into three main categories:

* :ref:`How to Guides`: User guides covering basic topics and use cases for the PVade software
* :ref:`Technical Reference`: Programming details on the PVade API and functions
* :ref:`Background`: Information and research sources for fluid and structural solvers and PV topics

New users may find it helpful to review the :ref:`Getting Started` materials first.
